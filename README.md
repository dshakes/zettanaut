# Zettanaut

**Navigate the AI Universe** — Your all-in-one AI intelligence hub with curated news, multi-track learning paths, research papers, and an AI-powered concept encyclopedia.

**Live:** [dshakes.github.io/zettanaut](https://dshakes.github.io/zettanaut/)

## What It Does

- **News** — Aggregates AI stories from Hacker News, Dev.to, Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA), and company blogs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, Meta AI, Microsoft AI, vLLM, Hugging Face, Lilian Weng)
- **Releases** — Curated major product and model launches (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek, etc.) plus trending HN release stories, filtered to exclude SDK noise
- **Papers** — Latest research from ArXiv, Semantic Scholar, and HuggingFace Daily Papers with citation counts and PDF links
- **Podcasts** — Curated directory of 10 top AI YouTube channels with pre-populated recent episodes (3 per channel), popular episodes horizontal carousel sorted by views, and live RSS feed updates every 4 hours. Channels include Y Combinator, Lex Fridman, Fireship, Andrej Karpathy, Two Minute Papers, Matt Wolfe, AI Explained, Dwarkesh Podcast, DeepLearning.AI, and Moonshots with Peter Diamandis
- **Resources** — Curated free and paid learning resources for beginners to advanced practitioners, filterable by cost and level
- **AI Engineer** — Comprehensive 16-week multi-track learning path (100+ curated tutorials) with collapsible stages and dynamic trending resources (fetched live from HN + Dev.to, scored by popularity/relevance). Shared 4-week foundation, then fork into 3 specializations (6 stages each):
  - **Applied AI Scientist** — Deep learning architectures, NLP & transformers, LLMs & fine-tuning, agentic AI, computer vision & multimodal AI, reinforcement learning & RLHF
  - **AI Platform Engineer** — MLOps fundamentals, LLM serving, agent infra & MCP gateways, guardrails & observability, GPU optimization & quantization, distributed training
  - **AI Software Engineer** — Prompt engineering & security, RAG & vectors, AI agents with MCP/A2A/LangGraph, production apps, evaluation & testing, full-stack AI patterns
- **AI Atlas** — LLM-powered concept encyclopedia. Search any AI concept and get instant, comprehensive explanations with key points, related concepts, and references. Supports OpenAI and Anthropic APIs with streaming and localStorage caching.
- **Archive** — Historical items older than one year across all categories
- **Highlights** — Top banner showcasing this week's major releases at a glance

### LLM Inference Focus

Built for inference specialists — topic filters on News and Releases tabs let you zero in on **LLM Inference** content: vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, quantization, KV cache, paged attention, speculative decoding, and more.

## Scoring Algorithm

Every item is scored on a 0–100 scale:

```
score = recency (35%) + engagement (35%) + authority (30%)
```

- **Recency** — Exponential decay: `100 * e^(-ageHours / 48)`
- **Engagement** — Normalized per source (HN points, Reddit upvotes, citations, stars)
- **Authority** — Source weight (company blogs: 1.0, ArXiv: 0.95, HN: 0.9, Reddit: 0.7)

## Tech Stack

- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** — Zero dependencies, no build step
- **ES6 modules** — Clean separation of concerns across 20+ modules
- **Client-side fetch** — All data pulled directly in the browser
- **LLM API integration** — OpenAI / Anthropic for AI Atlas concept search (API key stored locally)
- **CORS proxy cascade** — Automatic fallback (allorigins → corsproxy.io) for blocked APIs
- **Stale-while-revalidate** — Pre-populated podcast data renders instantly; live RSS updates silently in background via `requestIdleCallback`
- **localStorage caching** — TTL-based with LRU eviction (10min news, 15min releases, 30min papers, 4h podcasts, 24h concepts)
- **Auto-refresh** — Configurable intervals, pauses when tab is hidden (Visibility API)
- **Material Design** — Google-style subtle colors, Roboto font, Material Icons
